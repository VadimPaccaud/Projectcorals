# Computational Methods and Tools - Project : Modeling the impact of temperature and anthropogenic activity on a coral ecosystem

## Project description

This program simulates in first the impact of temperature on a coral reef in Gili Island. In a second time, the program simulate a release of pollutants and how it impacts the corals.

The program will:
1. Solve a differential system equations and save the results in a CSV file ("*resolution_modelisation.c*")
2. Plot the results of the CSV file ("*visualisation_modele.py*")
3. Simulate the release of CO2 in atmosphere and how it's affect the pH of the ocean and save the results in 3 CSV file ("*main_humanimpact.c*")
4. Plot the results of the two CSV file ("*visualisation_pollution.py*" and "*visualisation_acidite.py*" respectively)
5. Apply linear regression method on datas collected in one of the CSV file and plot it ("*linearregression.py*")
6. All graphs results obtained, and key figures will be saved in "*Results*" as .png .

## Project structure

- As the data used were few in number, it was quicker to write them directly to the code. We mention them in the code. 
- "*Internal*" contains files used for passing information between C and Python. They are automatically edited by the program and should not be manually modified.
- "*Code*" contains program code.
- "*Results*" contains saved .jpg files of graphs and a summary .txt file.

### Inputs and Outputs

Inputs:
- As the data used were few in number, it was quicker to write them directly to the code. We mention them in the code.

Internal files:
- "*Internal/ecosystem_simulation_results.csv*" is a comma-delimited file.
- "*Internal/CO2_terrain.csv*" , 1 column and 10'000 rows file.
- "*Internal/acidite_terrain.csv*", 1 column and 10'000 rows file.
- "*Internal/valeurs_uniques_pH_sante.csv*" , is a comma-delimited file.

Outputs:
- "*Outputs*" contains several image files, each has a custom name of format: "*name.png*". 
- "*C02_atmosphere_figure.png*" is an image file, showing the C02 concentration in the atmosphere
- "*pH_water_figure.png*" is an image file, showing the pH of water
- "*observation_results.png*" is an image file, plotting the datas collected
- "*final_curve.png*" is an image file, plotting the relation between coral health and the pH of water

## Implementation details

**Overview:**

- The simulation is handled by C. It directly outputs the results of computation into a CSV file.
- Python reads CSV file values, which contains parameters selected by the user and plot CSV contents.
- The simulation is handled by C. It directly outputs the results of computation into 3 other CSV file ( **Internal/CO2_terrain.csv** , **Internal/acidite_terrain.csv** , **Internal/valeurs_uniques_pH_sante.csv** ).
- 2 Python program reads  **Internal/CO2_terrain.csv** and **Internal/acidite_terrain.csv** respectively, which contains parameters selected by the user and plot CSV contents.
- The last Python program make the linear regression with the Numpy modul and plot the results.

**Structure**: In the directory "*Code/*" are located:
- "*RhineData.py*"
    - Reads in the CSVs located in "*Data*".
    - Computes average monthly values of river parameters : flowrate / temperature / dissolved oxygen...
- "*Parameterchoice.py*"
    - Imports "*RhineData.py*" as a module.
    - Writes all selected parameters ("*RhineData.py*" + pollution values) into a text file "*Internal/PythonParameters.txt*".
- "*Computations.c*"
    - Reads in "*Internal/PythonParameters.txt*".
    - Performs computations.
    - Exports results into the CSV "*Internal/CalculatedData.csv*".
- "*Visualisation.py*"
    - Executes the compiled C file.
    - Reads in the CSV "*Internal/CalculatedData.csv*".
    - Plots results in a separate window.
    - Saves key plots to directory "*Results*".
    - Writes a summary file to "*Results*".

## Instructions

To reproduce results in the report, four steps should be followed:
1. Navigate to the "*ecosystem_simulation.c*" function located in the "*Code*" directory. The function contains commented instructions for the user to modify input parameters. Modify as desired, and save the file.
2. Open a new terminal (C) and compile the file by using the following command:

                   gcc Code/ecosystem_simulation.c -lm
Write in terminal the command:
                    ./a.out
You should have the csv files in internal folder. Save the file. 
   
3. Open the makefile, change the line 16 (PYTHON variable) by your python path:

4. Run the following line in the terminal of makefile file:
    ```
    make
    ```
The program (python codes) will run automatically, and will open five plotting windows in full screen. Once you close them, they are stocked in ouptut.

### Data

The data files "*Rhine_DO_Palmrainbr√ºcke.csv*", "*Rhine_Flowrate_Rheinhalle.csv*"  and "*Rhine_Watertemperature_Palmrainbrucke.csv*" come from the [Swiss Federal Bureau for the Environment](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/water/state/data/obtaining-monitoring-data-on-the-topic-of-water/hydrological-data-service-for-watercourses-and-lakes.html).

The data file "*Rhine_depth.csv*" comes from the [French eauFrance](hydro.eaufrance.fr).

The data file "*Rhine_windspeeds.txt*" comes from the [Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/service/weather-and-climate-products/data-portal-for-teaching-and-research.html).

### Formulae

The function tracking dissolved oxygen relies on the [Streeter-Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streeter%E2%80%93Phelps_equation) equation, taken from Pearson's *[Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science](https://www.pearson.com/en-gb/subject-catalog/p/introduction-to-environmental-engineering-and-science-pearson-new-international-edition/P200000004949/9781292025759)*.

The function tracking pollutant concentrations is based on the Van Genuchten equation, solved by Jin & al in *[Mitigation of impact of a major benzene spill into a river](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135420300257)*.
